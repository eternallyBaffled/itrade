NOTE: Code is currently not ready for Python 3.
Dependencies reflect this and are currently pinned to the latest version that still supports Python 2.7.
This also means some dependencies are missing important security fixes!
DO NOT use this code if you don't understand what that means for you.
You have been warned.

The iTrade project is an open source initiative to provide a charting and
trading system written in Python language.
