Yahoo! Finance offers access to historical quote data in tabular format in several
timeframes: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Dividends. The historical quotes feature
includes notations for all splits and dividend distributions during the date range
covered. Open, high, low, and close quotes are not adjusted for splits or dividends.
An additional column, Adjusted Close, is provided that shows the close price adjusted
for all splits and dividends.
On the Historical Quotes page, you can choose the date range of the data displayed,
change the ticker symbol query, or switch to a different timeframe format. If the
data requested is beyond the range of historical quotes available through Yahoo!
Finance, all available data within the range will be displayed. Historical quotes
typically do not go back further than 1970.

There is currently no restriction to the amount of historical quote data you can
request, however, only 66 rows will be displayed at a time. To see all all the
data you've requested, click the "Download to Spreadsheet" link at the bottom of
the page. Note that dividend information is not included in the downloaded spreadsheet.
However, dividend data can be downloaded separately when the "Dividends Only" button
is clicked.

Daily Historical Quotes provide you with the daily open, high, low, close, and
volume for each trading day in the chosen date range.

Weekly Historical Quotes retrieve the open trade from the first trading day for
the week, the high and low price quotes of the week, and the closing price on the
last trading day of the week. The weekly volume is the average daily volume for
all trading days in the reported week.

Monthly Historical Quotes report the open trade from the first trading day of the
month, the high and low price quotes for the month, and the closing price on the
last trading day of the month. The monthly volume is the average daily volume for
all trading days in the reported month.

Historical Dividends report the dividend distributed by a company and the
ex-dividend date of the distribution.

Adjusted Close provides the closing price for the requested day, week, or month,
adjusted for all applicable splits and dividend distributions. Data is adjusted
using appropriate split and dividend multipliers, adhering to CRSP (Center for
Research in Security Prices) standards. Split multipliers are determined by the
split ratio. For instance, in a 2 for 1 split, the pre-split data is multiplied
by 0.5. Dividend multipliers are calculated based on dividend as a percentage of
price, primarily to avoid negative historical pricing. For example, when a $0.08
cash dividend is distributed on Feb 19 (ex-date), and the Feb 18 closing price was
24.96, the pre-dividend data is multiplied by (1-0.08/24.96) = 0.9968. Below is a
detailed example of adjusted close calculations.
Example: Adjusted Close Calculations

2/13/03 Close = 46.99
2/14/03 Close = 48.30
2/18/03 Split = 2:1
2/18/03 Close = 24.96
2/19/03 Cash Dividend = 0.08 (ex-date)
2/19/03 Close = 24.53


Split Multiplier = 0.5
Dividend Multiplier = 1 – (0.08/24.96) = 0.9968


2/13/03 Adj. Close = 0.5 * 0.9968 * 46.99 = 23.42
2/14/03 Adj. Close = 0.5 * 0.9968 * 48.30 = 24.07
2/18/03 Adj. Close = 0.9968 * 24.96 = 24.88
2/19/03 Adj. Close = 24.53


A "Download to Spreadsheet" link is available at the bottom of each historical
table. Selecting this option allows you to download the data as a .CSV file for
use with a spreadsheet program. Dividend data can be separately downloaded by
clicking the "Dividends Only" button and then clicking the "Download to Spreadsheet"
link. International ticker downloads are limited to 200 rows of data due to contractual
obligations with our data provider.
